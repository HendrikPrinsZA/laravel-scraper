## Fetching data bedind authenticated portals
This could be particularly useful with scraping data from Medium.com, as a lot of authors post their content behind the paywall. 

### [Symfony BrowserKit Component](https://symfony.com/components/BrowserKit)

Fetching data behind a paywall is challenging and very limited. As some of these online services don't provide an API layer. One alternative is to replicate the user's normal authentication journey to get to the data.
